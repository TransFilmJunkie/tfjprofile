            <p>Welcome to my little slice of the Internet. 
                I have created this webpage as both a tool and a repository of my personal accomplishments thus far. 
               </p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9579;</p>
			<p>Throughout the last four years, I have gained a variety of skills that would be very useful in a wide
                variety of roles. I have proficiency in several elements of website construction, including HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, and React.
                In addition, I also have a decent understanding of Python, SQL, and C++, and will also have gained proficiency in Java as well. 
                As well as these programming languages, I am also familiar with several other aspects of computer hardware and operations,
                including building PCs and several aspects of network design and administration. I also possess the PC Pro certification
                from the TestOut Corporation and an Excel White Badge, and will graduate from Wilmington University in December of 2024
                with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9579;</p>
            <p>In addition to my abilities in the design and operation of computer hardware and software, I also have some talents in photography as well.
                As a result, I would be able to assist in creating product images and would not need to rely on stock images for any webpage projects as well,
                since I would be more than capable of either capturing new images or using previous photographs to convey the vision that the client 
                intended to achieve.
